🛒 Product Management App

A simple Product Management Web App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows you to add, update, delete, search, and store products in your browser using Local Storage.

🚀 Features

Add Products → Add product name, price, category, amount, and discount.

Update Products → Modify existing product details.

Delete Products → Remove products from the list.

Search Products → Search by:

Product name

Category

Price

Price Calculation → Automatically calculates the final price after discount.

Total Calculation → Shows the total value of all products.

Persistent Data → Products are saved in localStorage, so they remain after page reload.

Responsive Design (CSS makes it look clean and usable on all devices).

🔄 CRUD Operations

This app demonstrates the four basic operations of persistent data management:

Create → Add new products with details (name, price, category, amount, discount).

Read → View all products in a dynamic table with real-time total & final price calculation.

Update → Edit existing products and instantly refresh the data.

Delete → Remove products permanently from the list and local storage.
